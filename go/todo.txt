* I want a way better compilation process
* Right now my compile time estimate is totally off because if you modify a file that's included in a bunch of other files then you get a huge compilation whereas edigint main is veyr small, if we want to estimate properly we need to be able to know how long each individual file takes to compile on average and when a compile runs we need to know which files content has changed and then for those files we can construct a good estimate.
* Sometimes there's a problem X and you make a change to the code base which you think will solve X, while that's compiling you make more changes, and now you additionally want to compile those new changes along with the fix for X in your mind the changes and solving X are disjoint so it shouldn't be a problem but then it doesn't work because those changes were not actually disjoint, to solve this there should be a compile queue where the code base is like copied somewhere and compiled in that form or something, just so we know what causes what almost.
